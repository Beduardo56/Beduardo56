# Bruno Eduardo Freire
<sub>*Machine Learning Engineer* at Time Energy</sub>

<sub>*Eletrical Engineer Student* at Unicamp</sub>

## My story
In 2018, I studied clinical maintenance systems at CEB-Unicamp, At this time I'd learned how to apply statistics to data analysis. In 2019, I entered in Time Energy, since then I have been working with ML applied to smart meters data (from creating data lake's architecture to deploying ML models).

My credentials include a Machine learning course from Stanford University, some courses about Python/SQL and a bootcamp that i've learned how to construct a data architecture (Lambda).

**Background in:** Python, Matlab, Machine Learning, Statistics, Energy, Signal Analysis, Clinical Engineering, Communication Systems, Numerical Calculus and Optimisation.
